This simple web page displays a [BAGeL Radio](https://www.bagelradio.com) playlist. I wrote it mostly because:

1. I didn't like the extra stuff at the top of the regular web site's playlist.
2. I wanted more control over the appearance.
3. Every time my stupid internet connection went down, the page would stop refreshing.

To use it, you can either go directly to this URL:

[`https://gribnif.github.io/bagel_playlist/bagel_playlist.html`](https://gribnif.github.io/bagel_playlist/bagel_playlist.html)

or, once there, you can download the source of the file to your device and then open that local copy in your browser.
